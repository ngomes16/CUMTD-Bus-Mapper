### BFS Traversal
  BFS traversal runs across all disconnected components in a directed graph.
  
### Graph visualization
  This project involves the use of the data collected to project bus routes with and without force-direction.
  
  #### Latitude-longitude

### Fastest-route finding

  Shortest-time paths between pairs of stations are found in consistent time as a function of O(|number of edges]) using the A*-Search algorithm with a great-circle distance heuristic. The process filters by day of the week and time of day, so as to only consider buses whihc are still running.
