# SFPA Team Contract
### **Communication**

1.  **Team Meetings**
Project stand-up meetings will be compulsory once a week, from 4 PM to 5 PM on Fridays. Meetings may be in-person or via the designated Discord voice channel. Rishi Sekhar will maintain records of task allocation and progress.
    
2.  **Assistance**
All project communication will be done via a designated Discord channel. Members will be expected to respond to pings within a 10 PM - 10 PM cycle.
    
3.  **Respect**
All members will have equal say in major project decisions, issues and on shared tasks, accounted for via polls. Suggestions by other members regarding any member's individual designated tasks are up to said member's discretion to accept. A larger problem in a member's work however would fall under the bracket of "issues', decided by a majority vote among other members.
    

### **Collaboration**

1.  **Work Distribution** 
Weekly deadlines will be subdivided into equal and ideally well-separated tasks, which will then be assigned to members. Tasks will be tracked on a comonly shared Trello board. Unforeseen work, if disruptively large, will be handled by a reconsideration of the weekly timeline. If minor, it can instead be assigned to any willing member. Initial allocation of tasks will be done on an opt-in basis via polls. 
    
2.  **Time Commitment**  
As long as set tasks are met, other individual time commitments will be treated as a non-issue.
    
3.  **Conflict Resolution**  
Disagreements between members will first be addressed as mentioned above. Stand-up meetings in the middle of the week are intended to help check progress more regularly, to avoid scenarios of members not completing their work for the week. Approaching course staff will only be considered failing all other attempts to remedy a major situation.

4. **Repository workflow**
Tasks will be designated in a manner so as to minimize merge conflicts between members' commits. To account for cases where conflicts do arise, as well as for general safety of the commit history, all GitHub pull requests will need to be approved by Justin Hu or Rishi Sekhar before merging.
